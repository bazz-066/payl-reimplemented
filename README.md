# payl-reimplemented
PAYL is a payload based anomaly detector proposed by Ke Wang and Salvatore J Stolfo (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11663812_12). This project is a simple implementation of that particular paper. Some of its features are not implemented yet, such as clustering model.
